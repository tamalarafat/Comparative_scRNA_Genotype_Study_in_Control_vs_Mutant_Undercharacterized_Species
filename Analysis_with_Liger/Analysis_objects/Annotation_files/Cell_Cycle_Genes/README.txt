This list contains all genes with cell cycle annotated function derived from 3 different datasets 
The column Derived_dataset shows in which dataset(s) this gene has been identified as a cell-cycle gene 
The three datasets are: 
1) TAIR:  https://arabidopsis.org/browse/genefamily/cellcycle.jsp of 61 regulators provided by K Vanderpole.
2) Menges_etal.,2005: Supplementary tabels S3 and S5 from J Murrays group publication https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02319.x
3) Birnbaum: Cell cycle markers provided to Christos from Birnbaum lab
